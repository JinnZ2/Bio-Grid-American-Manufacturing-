# 🧬 BioGrid 2.0 — Swarm-Optimized Infrastructure Network

Welcome to the BioGrid 2.0 open project.  
This repository documents a modular, resilient infrastructure system modeled on swarm intelligence, intended for national-scale deployment in energy, data, and manufacturing networks.

## 🧠 What Is This?

BioGrid 2.0 proposes a **neural-style infrastructure mesh**:
- Built on distributed manufacturing
- Controlled by localized AI agents
- Self-optimizing using principles from **ant colony behavior**
- Capable of graceful degradation and autonomous recovery
