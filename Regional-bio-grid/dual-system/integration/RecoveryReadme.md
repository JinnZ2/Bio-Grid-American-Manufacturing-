#  BioGrid Data Recovery System

Self-healing, Ï†-optimized, multi-layer data recovery architecture.

##  Recovery Layers

- **Biological Memory**: Recovers from mycelial state + neural path logs
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Rebuilds ant colony state from distributed memory
- **Geometric Ï† Recovery**: Reconstructs network from spiral geometry
- **Real-World Anchoring**: Aligns with NOAA, BNSF, and port data

##  Continuous Backup & Detection

Runs automatically:

- Backup every 5 minutes
- Corruption scan every 1 minute
- Confidence-based recovery threshold: 99.95%

## ðŸ§ª Setup

```js
const resilientBioGrid = new BioGridWithRecovery(bioGridConfig);
