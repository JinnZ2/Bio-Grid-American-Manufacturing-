# Feasibility Overview Summary: BioGrid System

## Core Premise
The BioGrid system integrates engineered biological infrastructure (mycelial networks) with digital ant-colony optimization to create resilient, adaptive, underground infrastructure for high-throughput logistics.

## Why It Works (Today)
- **Biological Computation:** Physarum polycephalum-based routing logic proven in academic research.
- **Bio-electronic Circuits:** Existing interface tech already used in neuroprosthetics.
- **Underground Fiber + Nutrient Tubes:** Use current tunneling tech (e.g. microtunneling, boring machines).
- **Cargo-agnostic:** Supports data, water, electricity, slurry, or microfreight.

## Real-World Target: Duluth–Superior Iron Range Corridor
- Real data: tonnage, distances, port capacities, seasonal shipping limitations
- Real geography: rail corridors, urban zoning, water tables
- Real constraint: seasonal ice closures force 8-month logistics window

## What Exists Now (in this Repo)
- Code for biologically viable routing (with real geographic constraints)
- Infrastructure specs for tunnel architecture in cold, wet soil
- Risk and investment landscape summary
- System health monitoring + healing logic in simulation form

## What’s Missing
- Physical pilot test
- Environmental permitting
- Legal + financial structure
- Public narrative/communication package

## TL;DR
System is **technically feasible now**, but not deployable without crossing regulatory, legal, political, and funding gauntlets. All that work is mapped here for the next person to run with.
