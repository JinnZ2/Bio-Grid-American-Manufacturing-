# BioGrid: Self-Healing, Bio-Electronic Infrastructure System

This repository contains early-stage research, engineering documentation, and prototype code for a novel underground infrastructure system that uses **engineered mycelial networks** combined with **bio-electronic signal routing**.

## What's In This Repo

- Full construction methodology for cold-region bio-tunnel infrastructure (MN-adapted)
- Hybrid neural network simulation (biological + digital)
- Risk and feasibility analysis for real-world deployment
- Breakdown of critical regulatory, financial, and operational challenges
- Source code for simulation of ant-colony-optimized neural routing over real Duluth-Superior logistics infrastructure

## Why It Matters

Conventional infrastructure is:
- Brittle
- Expensive to maintain
- Environmentally harmful

This project proposes a path forward that is:
- Self-healing
- Adaptive
- Environmentally integrated

## Who Should Read This

If you’re an engineer, synthetic biologist, systems designer, or investor looking to understand how living systems can form the next generation of infrastructure, this repository is for you.

If you’re a regulatory official or government partner, [start here → docs/Feasibility_Overview_Summary.md](./docs/Feasibility_Overview_Summary.md).

## Disclaimer

This is pre-deployment research and not yet validated at industrial scale. Think of it as an open-world sandbox for real infrastructure nerds.
