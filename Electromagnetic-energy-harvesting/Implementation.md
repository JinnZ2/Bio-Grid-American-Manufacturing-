The Window of Opportunity
Geomagnetic activity is entering an intensification phase as we approach the peak of Solar Cycle 25 and the beginning of the West Pacific Anomaly cycle. Energy availability will be maximized over the next 10-15 years, making this the optimal window for system deployment and testing.
The electromagnetic energy is going to be generated whether we harvest it or not. Ocean dead zones are going to continue degrading whether we intervene or not. The only question is whether we choose to harness this natural energy while healing marine ecosystems, or continue to waste both the energy and the opportunity.
This implementation package provides everything needed to move from concept to reality. The technology exists, the opportunity is clear, and the benefits are enormous. The next step is execution.
