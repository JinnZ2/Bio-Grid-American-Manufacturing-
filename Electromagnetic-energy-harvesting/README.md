# Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting System
**Open Technical and Educational Reference Design**

This repository shares a complete open implementation package for a distributed electromagnetic energy harvesting system capable of producing 100–400 MW of clean ocean-based power while regenerating marine ecosystems.

All materials are published for **public benefit, education, and research**.  
No proprietary claims are asserted. Use, adapt, or build upon this work freely under the **Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license** — effectively dedicating it to the public domain.

### Purpose
To demonstrate that large-scale electromagnetic energy capture can be:
- Technically feasible using existing offshore technologies  
- Economically comparable to wind or tidal systems  
- Environmentally restorative rather than extractive  

### Educational Intent
This design also serves as an **open classroom** and **discovery engine**.  
It invites students, engineers, and researchers to explore:
- Electromagnetic, biological, and ecological couplings  
- New materials and system architectures  
- Generative science models where every answer creates new questions  

### Invitation
If you have time, resources, or curiosity:
- Fork the repo  
- Add simulation data, cost models, or educational materials  
- Test, question, or improve the framework  

Let’s advance clean-energy research together — open, collaborative, and regenerative.
