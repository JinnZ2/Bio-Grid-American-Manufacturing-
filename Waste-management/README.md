# NERE: Using Instability to Multiply Landfill Energy

Landfills emit 1.5 Gt CO₂ annually while sitting on 2.3 EJ of chemical energy.

Standard approach: suppress instability, capture what's left.
This framework: use controlled instability to multiply output 3-8×.

Three inversions:
1. Additive → Multiplicative (parametric pumping)
2. Liability → Asset (leachate as coolant, rust as antenna)
3. Stability → Controlled instability (thermal runaway as power source)

Core concepts: Controlled Thermal Excursion (CTX), Active Adaptive Damping Control (AADC), Self-Adjusting Metamaterial Geometry (SAMG).

Not a complete design. A framework for whoever wants to build it.
