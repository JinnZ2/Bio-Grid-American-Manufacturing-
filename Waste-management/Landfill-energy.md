# Braided Energy Systems Implementation Plan

## From Concept to Commercial Deployment

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the systematic development and deployment of braided energy harvesting systems for two primary applications:

1. **Microplastics Environmental Cleanup** - Energy-positive pollution remediation
