# Open Questions and Exploration Pathways

This framework is theoretically complete. What follows are the questions that emerge naturally from the theory - the invitations to explore, measure, and learn. These aren't obstacles. They're the interesting parts.

Each question has a pathway to answers. Some through simulation, some through lab work, some through field observation. All are addressable.

## 1. Quenching Kinetics in Real Waste

**The question**: How quickly can we drop temperature in different waste types, and what does that tell us about waste composition?

**What we know**:
- Arrhenius equation predicts reaction rate exponentially sensitive to temperature
- Standard quenching works in industrial reactors (controlled composition)
- Landfill waste composition varies massively by location and depth

**What we'd like to learn**:
- Critical quenching rate R_quench for different waste types
- Effective thermal diffusivity α through compacted, heterogeneous waste
- Minimum safe distance between CTX zones
- Whether inert gas or circulated coolant couples better
- Real-world response time from sensor trigger to achieved quench

**How to find out**:
[rest of validation pathway...]

**What we learn**: Not just "can we quench safely" but "what does quenching behavior tell us about waste structure?"
