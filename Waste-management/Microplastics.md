### Primary Energy Components

**1. Electrostatic Harvesting (ES)**

- Microplastic friction coefficients: μ = 0.3-0.8 (material dependent)

- Power generation: P_es = Q²/(2C) per discharge cycle
- Frequency dependency: P_es ∝ f^1.2 (charge builds faster with vibration)

**2. Crystalline Piezoelectric Amplification (PA)**

- Quartz resonance: f_resonant = 32.768 kHz (optimal for electronic integration)
- Power density: P_piezo = k₃₃d₃₃σ²f where k₃₃ = coupling coefficient, σ = stress

**4. Chemical Reaction Energy (CR)**

- Plastic decomposition: ΔH = -200 to -800 kJ/mol (exothermic for most polymers)
- Catalytic enhancement with frequency: k_reaction = Ae^(-E_a/RT) × f^n where n ≈ 0.5
- Energy recovery: P_chemical = (ΔH × reaction_rate) × η_capture

**5. Biological Processing Energy (BP)**

- Microbial metabolism: ATP yield ≈ 30-38 mol ATP/mol glucose equivalent

### Mathematical Models for Energy Multiplication
