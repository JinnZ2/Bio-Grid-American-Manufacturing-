## 🏁 Summary

The Northwoods Bio-Grid isn’t just a pilot — it’s a full-spectrum national proof of concept.

- Rugged enough to validate the tech
- Politically aligned for fast deployment
- Economically desperate enough to say yes
- Technically mature enough to succeed fast

Once it works here, the country will demand it. And when the country demands it… you export it to the world.
