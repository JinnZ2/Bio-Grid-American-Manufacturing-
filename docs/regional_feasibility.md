# 🧭 Regional Feasibility Model for BioGrid Implementation

This model helps determine if a region is suitable for decentralized BioGrid deployment. The goal is to identify areas where self-healing infrastructure can function *without* centralized dependencies.

## 🧱 Core Criteria

| Factor                  | Description                                               | Ideal Range       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 🌐 Connectivity         | Basic LoRa / mesh / Wi-Fi availability                    | Any intermittent mesh |
| 🔋 Power Availability   | Minimal power (solar, battery, kinetic)                   | Micro power ok    |
| 🌱 Terrain Resilience   | Natural or urban terrain that needs self-repair capability| Forest, industrial, rural |
| 🧠 Local Autonomy       | Region has need for autonomous systems (off-grid, remote) | Strong need = ideal |
| 🧬 Sensor Viability     | Sensors can operate despite conditions                    | 1–3 sensors/node  |
| 🏘️ Node Density         | Can support 3–30 nodes/km² without centralized control   | Medium-density OK |

## 📍 Deployment Archetypes

### 🔹 1. **Forest Edge Regions**
- Bio-grid protects against environmental degradation (fires, erosion)
- Self-healing nodes respond to temperature, wind, soil moisture
- Useful for climate modeling and forest fire prediction

### 🔹 2. **Post-Industrial Zones**
- Abandoned buildings or infrastructure in decay
- Nodes map deterioration and form emergent repair plans
- Use in retrofitting, insurance modeling, autonomous inspection

### 🔹 3. **Farming Villages / Off-grid Hamlets**
- No central control or broadband
- Swarm builds consensus on power levels, crop status, sensor feedback
- Adds fail-safes to rural electrification, irrigation, or solar microgrids

### 🔹 4. **Disaster Response Zones**
- After storms or quakes, deploy swarm to find damage and plan routing
- Mesh net deploys from drone drop or foot patrol
- Nodes coordinate recovery without outside communication

## 🔧 Integration Notes

- Nodes don’t need perfect uptime — swarm behavior thrives on chaos
- Can combine digital (sim) and physical (real) nodes
- Swarm adapts to sensor failures and loss of connectivity

## 📡 Feasibility Estimator Formula

You can adapt this for your region using:

```plaintext
Feasibility Score = 
  (0.25 * Connectivity) +
  (0.20 * Autonomy Need) +
  (0.15 * Terrain Complexity) +
  (0.15 * Power Availability) +
  (0.15 * Sensor Viability) +
  (0.10 * Node Density Support)

Range: 0.0 to 1.0
Threshold for deployment: > 0.6
