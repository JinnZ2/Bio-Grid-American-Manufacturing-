## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Phase B1: Foundation Blueprint (Next 48 Hours)
- Design first **3D pod** with crop-circle geometry
- Map **underground-to-sky energy flow**
- Build technical specs for **volumetric construction**

### Phase B2: Prototype Construction (Next 2 Weeks)
- Desktop 3D model of full energy pod
- Test **helical energy flows** and **spherical energy storage**
- Validate **storage efficiency** over 2D infrastructure

### Phase B3: Partnership Acceleration (Next 30 Days)
- Michigan Tech: 3D city **research & deployment partnership**
- Site selection in Upper Peninsula for **first pod**
- **Funding deck** featuring revolutionary 3D approach
