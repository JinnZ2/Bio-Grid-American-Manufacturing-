## 🏗️ Infrastructure Layer Risk

| Layer | Risk Level | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Primary Grid Deployment | Medium | Undergrounding + deep freeze tolerance validated |
| Secondary Distribution | Low | 2,500km existing corridor overlap |
| Edge Node Mesh | Medium | Fibonacci spacing resilient to node loss |
| Lake/Cross-Border Cable Links | Medium-High | International permitting & thermal variance |
| Smart Switching | Low | AI/MLOps redundant via fallback switching |

## 💻 Technical Layer Risk

| Component | Risk Level | Detail |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| AI Core Stability | Low | NVIDIA H100 cluster + self-balancing |
| Sensor Integration | Medium | IOT fragility mitigated via triple-link bus |
| Middleware Interfacing | Medium | Clean abstraction layers, modular |
| Neural Hub ↔ Node Sync | High | Latency variance in harsh terrain |
| Comms Protocol Stack | Medium | 5G primary, RF backup, mesh fallback |

## 💸 Financial & Economic Risks

| Type | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| CAPEX Overrun | Medium | 35% projected in worst case |
| Deployment Delay | Medium-High | Weather, permitting, materials access |
| ROI Uncertainty | Low | Conservative 4.2-year payback modeled |
| Public Opposition | Medium | Low in rural, moderate in urban junctions |
| Private Sector Pullout | Low | Multilateral investment frameworks in place |

## 🏛️ Political / Regulatory Risks

| Vector | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Regulatory Delay | High | State-by-state grid laws diverge |
| Permitting Resistance | Medium | Streamlined environmental model helps |
| Defense Reclassification | Low | Already tied to strategic manufacturing base |
| Cross-border Interference | Medium | Canadian integration pending coordination |
| Legislative Lapse | Medium-High | 2026 elections may cause funding reshuffle |
