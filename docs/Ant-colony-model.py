#  Ant Colony Bio-Electronic Model

## Concept Overview

Inspired by decentralized intelligence and cooperative logic of ants, this model enables:
- Distributed task assignment
- Real-time feedback loops via chemical + electromagnetic signals
- Adaptive routing of bio-manufacturing and power logic
- Self-healing and redundancy behaviors

---

## Core Features

- **Pheromone Equivalent:** CRISPR/gene expression gradients or light field sensors
- **Task Switching:** Based on energy/resource signal thresholds
- **Multi-Agent Scaling:** Thousands of micro/nano bio-nodes act as coordinated swarm
- **Failure Recovery:** Dead nodes trigger reroute and restructuring automatically

---

## Application to BioGrid

| Colony Function | BioGrid Function |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Forager ants     | Sensor scouts across rural zones |
| Soldier ants     | Stability modules protecting grid |
| Queen logic      | Seed generation + evolutionary memory |
| Nest building    | Construction of biocomposite structures |

---

## Technical Extensions

- Coupled magnetic + mycelial networks
- Directional conductivity trails
- Integration with Shape Intelligence Engine

---

## Future Simulation Plan

- Deploy symbolic agents with ant-like traits
- Observe for emergent routing and repair patterns
- Quantify signal density vs task efficiency
