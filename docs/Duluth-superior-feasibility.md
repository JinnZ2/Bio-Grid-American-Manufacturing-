Duluth-Superior BioGrid Pilot Program

Feasibility & Infrastructure Validation

⸻

 Geographic Anchor: Duluth-Superior Port Hub

Real Coordinates:
	•	Duluth Port: 46.7833°N, 92.1005°W
	•	49 miles of harbor frontage
	•	35M tons cargo annually
	•	Seaway depth: 26–30 ft

Integrated Transport Infrastructure:
	•	Rail Link: 47-mile Iron Range rail route to Silver Bay
	•	Bridges: Blatnik Bridge (1965), Bong Memorial Bridge (1985)
	•	Shipping Routes: Direct access to Great Lakes steel mills (Gary, Cleveland)

⸻

 Industrial Feeds: Iron, Coal, and Cargo

Iron Range Mining:
	•	Minntac: Largest taconite site in North America (15M tons/year)
	•	Northshore Mining: DR-grade pellet producer for green steel
	•	Total Output: 40M tons of iron ore annually

Coal Processing:
	•	Superior Terminal: 25.5M tons/year capacity – largest in U.S.

BioGrid Use Case Alignment:
	•	Optimize real-time cargo balancing (iron/coal/grain)
	•	Enable predictive maintenance and load coordination
	•	Integrate with existing transport + export channels

 Feasibility: CRISPR-Integrated BioManufacturing

Phase 1: Rapid Partnership Activation
	•	Contact:
	•	Branden Moriarity, PhD (UMN) – Clinical CRISPR expert
	•	C. Dustin Rubinstein, PhD (UW) – Director, Genome Editing Lab
	•	Execute partnership agreements using existing IP, cleanrooms, and personnel

Phase 2: Facility Upgrade Plan

Upgrade
Purpose
Cost
CRISPR Manufacturing Expansion
Mycelial/genetic organism scaling
$50M
Equipment for Biocompatibility + Industrial Output
Hardware & QA
$25M
Staffing & Training
Technical operators
$15M
Total
$90M


Compare to $2.5B + 24mo for new build → 87% cost savings, 75% faster deployment.

Phase 3: Pilot Execution Timeline
	•	Existing port + mining integration = real cargo testing
	•	CRISPR-enabled smart biomaterials (e.g., cold-weather mycelial biocomposites)
	•	Sensor-driven optimization from mine to market
	•	Green steel adaptation planning (DR-pellets to EAF)
