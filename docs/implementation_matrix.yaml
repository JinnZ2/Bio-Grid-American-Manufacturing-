deployment_regions:
  - name: Northwoods MWI
    states: ["MN", "WI", "MI"]
    features:
      - underground fiber + power
      - snow-hardened sensor grid
      - neural control pilot
      - edge node uplink (Lake Superior)
    status: alpha
    eta: Q2 2026

  - name: Urban Edge (Beta Zones)
    cities: ["Chicago", "Cleveland", "Detroit"]
    features:
      - brownfield deployment
      - AI air quality optimization
      - adaptive traffic + power
    status: design
    eta: Q4 2026

core_modules:
  - id: A-1
    name: AntSwarmKnowledge
    type: behavioral_simulation
    role: route optimization + memory
  - id: N-4
    name: NeuralControlUnit
    type: decision_node
    role: grid adaptation / failure fallback
  - id: M-2
    name: ManufacturingMesh
    type: logistics_node
    role: factory optimization + delivery timing

governance_model:
  - level: local
    body: node councils
    interface: open web dashboard
  - level: state
    body: regulatory sandbox boards
    interface: encrypted oversight ports
  - level: federal
    body: infrastructure joint authority
    interface: audit trail + swarm sync readouts

failover_procedures:
  - case: sensor blackout
    response: activate AI fallback mode w/ 10s delay
  - case: energy spike
    response: isolate node + reroute swarm memory
  - case: malicious actor detected
    response: shut down affected region, preserve logs, decentralize memory to peer nodes

notes:
  - All swarm memory is ephemeral unless manually preserved.
  - AI agents are capped at 5 layers of predictive depth.
  - Emergency override must be physical, analog, and local.
