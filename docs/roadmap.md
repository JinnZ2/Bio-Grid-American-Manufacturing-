# 🛣️ BioGrid 2.0 Roadmap

A decentralized path forward for the intelligent grid.  
This is not a product release schedule — it's a blueprint for distributed evolution.

---

## ✅ Phase I: Foundation (2024–2025)

> *"Start with the swarm, end with the system."*

- [x] Build core AntSwarmKnowledge simulator
- [x] Publish decoded strategic documentation
- [x] Document risk landscape and grid philosophy
- [x] Open source under MIT license
- [x] Validate architecture with zero-budget deployment ( done via phone)

---

## 🔄 Phase II: Expansion (Late 2025–2026)

> *"Make it real, but keep it weird."*

- [ ] Enable GitHub Discussions for community input
- [ ] Add real-time simulation parameters (via `config.json`)
- [ ] Build demoable offline-first web interface
- [ ] Connect knowledge nodes to external data (e.g., energy APIs)
- [ ] Add mobile interface to control swarm (yes, control the ants)

---

## 🚀 Phase III: Integration (2026–2027)

> *"Connect the model to the matter."*

- [ ] Partner with rural testbeds (universities, co-ops, hacker farms)
- [ ] Translate into low-cost edge hardware (e.g., RPi, ESP32)
- [ ] Publish manufacturing node prototypes
- [ ] Begin test mesh network deployments
- [ ] Draft civic integration guide for municipalities

---

## 🌍 Phase IV: Federation (2027+)

> *"Infrastructure becomes culture."*

- [ ] Decentralize governance: node councils + swarm consensus trials
- [ ] Launch `GridCommons.org` to host mirror networks and simulators
- [ ] Forks encouraged: for climate, for autonomy, for resilience
- [ ] Add poetry (seriously)

---

## 🐜 Side Quests

- [ ] Build “Ant Memory Visualizer” for trace heatmaps
- [ ] Add `docs/philosophy.md` because people will ask
- [ ] Write a speculative short story set in a BioGrid-powered nation
