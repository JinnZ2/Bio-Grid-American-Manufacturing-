# 📍 Regional Feasibility Summary

This implementation is designed for deployment in **post-industrial regions** with mixed terrain and legacy infrastructure. The Great Lakes region is uniquely viable due to:

- ✅ Abundant water (cooling, hydro, redundancy)
- ✅ Urban-rural hybrid grid zones
- ✅ Existing decay (ideal for retro-fit and test)
- ✅ Political appetite for "manufacturing renaissance"

## 📊 Region Scoring

| Region          | Feasibility Score | Strengths                        |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Great Lakes     | 0.87             | Urban decay, grid demand, cooling source |
| Texas           | 0.79             | Decentralized grid, sun-rich, rural autonomy |
| Rocky Mountains | 0.83             | Fire zones, remote towns, terrain intelligence |

## 📦 Minimum Deployment
