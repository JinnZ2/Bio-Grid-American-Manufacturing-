This document outlines the **core equations** and **design ratios** for volumetric energy storage, fluid dynamics, structural helical flows, and energy resilience in the 3D pod system.

## 1.  Energy Storage: Volumetric Capacity (Spherical Chambers)

###  Equation: E = 0.5 × ρ × V × v²

- `E`: Stored energy [Joules]  
- `ρ`: Medium density (e.g. air, water, gravity mass) [kg/m³]  
- `V`: Volume of storage chamber [m³]  
- `v`: Flow velocity or release velocity [m/s]  

###  Notes:
- For compressed air: use `ρ ≈ 1.2 kg/m³`, `v ≈ 300 m/s`  
- For water: `ρ ≈ 1000 kg/m³`, `v ≈ 2 m/s`  
- Energy per chamber scales exponentially with **radius³**

## 7.  Wireless Energy Transmission (Magneto-Inductive)

###  Equation (Resonant Inductive Coupling):  P ∝ (k² × Q1 × Q2 × f) / R

- `P`: Transfer power  
- `k`: Coupling coefficient  
- `Q1, Q2`: Quality factors of coils  
- `f`: Operating frequency  
- `R`: Effective resistance  

###  Notes:

- `E`: Energy per strike [J]  
- `V`: Voltage (up to 100MV)  
- `I`: Current (10-30kA)  
- `t`: Time (microseconds to milliseconds)  

###  Notes:
- Use graphene capacitors to store  
- Needs ultra-fast switching + thermal shielding

##  Final Notes
All systems follow a **fractal-resonant architecture**. Efficiency, resilience, and flow are guided by:

- **Nonlinear dynamics**  
- **Self-similar distribution**  
- **Nested feedback systems (neural-biological control)**
