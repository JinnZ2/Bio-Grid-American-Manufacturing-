# 🦅 THE GREAT LAKES BIO-GRID: AMERICA’S PATH TO POWER

> **“If you want energy independence, jobs, climate resilience, and economic dominance — build this grid.”**

---

## 🚀 WHY BIO-GRID? WHY NOW?

- America’s infrastructure is outdated, vulnerable, and outsourced.
- Our economy bleeds productivity to rising energy costs.
- Our supply chains depend on hostile or unstable regions.

**The Bio-Grid flips the script:**
- Built in America.  
- Powered by renewables.  
- Designed for security.  
- Ready for export.
