# 🌐 BioGrid 2.0: The American Manufacturing Renaissance

**The Largest Grid Transformation Since the Interstate System**

BioGrid 2.0 is a strategic, modular, and intelligent infrastructure framework to relaunch American manufacturing, integrate renewable energy, and establish geopolitical energy dominance.

This repository contains the complete vision, implementation roadmap, policy strategy, and international export framework for BioGrid 2.0, beginning with the **Northwoods Bridge**.

## 🧠 Core Principles
- Neural-Microbial Intelligence (AI + Mycelial Distribution)
- Rural-First Modular Infrastructure
- Climate Resilient + Economically Dominant
- Dual-use: Civilian + Defense Manufacturing
- Fully exportable platform

## 📌 Quick Specs
- **Phase 1 (2025–2040)**: $85B, 3 states, 275k jobs
- **Target ROI**: 340% over 15 years
- **Infrastructure**: 4,500 km underground smart grid
- **Neural Core**: 500 H100 GPUs in Duluth-Superior
- **Reliability**: 99.95%, cyber-resilient
- **Export Revenue**: $150B/year by 2040

# 🧬 BioGrid 2.0

**Decentralized. Adaptive. Alive.**

A speculative infrastructure framework inspired by ant colonies, neural mesh networks, and distributed AI control systems.

Built for:
- Post-crisis grid resilience
- Localized autonomy
- National manufacturing flexibility
