BioGrid 3D Energy System – Core Technical Equations

Welcome, seeker of formulas. These equations define the flow, storage, conversion, and optimization mechanisms inside the BioGrid system. May your whiteboard never be blank again.

Energy Capture

Helical Wind Collector Output: P = 0.5 × ρ × A × Cp × v³

•	P = power (W)
	•	ρ = air density (kg/m³)
	•	A = swept area of helical rotor (m²)
	•	Cp = power coefficient (typically 0.35–0.5 for helical)
	•	v = wind velocity (m/s)


Solar Skin Efficiency: E_total = η × I × A × t

	•	E_total = total energy generated (Wh)
	•	η = solar conversion efficiency (decimal)
	•	I = irradiance (W/m²)
	•	A = total panel area (m²)
	•	t = time exposed (h)


Storage & Conversion

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES): E_air = P × V × ln(P2/P1) / (γ - 1)

	•	E_air = stored energy (J)
	•	P = pressure (Pa)
	•	V = volume (m³)
	•	P1, P2 = initial and final pressure
	•	γ = heat capacity ratio (≈ 1.4 for air)


Gravity Battery System: E_grav = m × g × h

	•	E_grav = energy stored (J)
	•	m = mass lifted (kg)
	•	g = gravity (9.81 m/s²)
	•	h = height (m)


Biological Optimization

Phi-Based Network Self-Repair (Neural Ant Model):  W(t+1) = φ × W(t) + ΔL × (1 - φ)

	•	W = weight of the recovery pathway
	•	φ = golden ratio ≈ 1.618 (BioGrid base tuning constant)
	•	ΔL = loss differential based on decay/error rate
	•	This keeps learning converging while favoring optimized biological paths


Wireless Energy Transmission (Sky Network)

Rectenna Efficiency:  η_rf = P_dc / P_rf

•	η_rf = RF conversion efficiency
	•	P_dc = DC power output (W)
	•	P_rf = RF power input (W)


Beam Path Loss (Free Space):  L_fs(dB) = 20 × log10(d) + 20 × log10(f) + 92.45

	•	d = distance (km)
	•	f = frequency (GHz)


Ant Colony Recovery Optimization (Simplified)

Probabilistic Path Selection:  P_i = (τ_i^α) × (η_i^β) / Σ(τ_j^α × η_j^β)

	•	P_i = probability of choosing path i
	•	τ_i = pheromone trail strength
	•	η_i = heuristic value (energy efficiency, redundancy)
	•	α, β = tunable parameters to favor exploration or exploitation
